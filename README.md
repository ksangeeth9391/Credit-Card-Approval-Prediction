# 💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction

A Machine Learning and Flask-based web application that predicts whether a credit card application is likely to be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on an applicant's financial and personal details. The application helps automate the credit card approval process by providing fast, accurate, and data-driven predictions using Machine Learning models.

---

# 📖 Project Overview

Credit card approval is one of the most important processes in the banking and financial sector. Traditional manual evaluation of applications can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project uses Machine Learning techniques to predict whether a credit card application will be approved based on applicant information.

The system performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using multiple classification algorithms. The best-performing model is integrated into a Flask web application and deployed on **Render**, enabling users to obtain real-time credit card approval predictions through an intuitive web interface.
